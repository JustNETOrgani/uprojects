Chapter 4: Implementation Results and System Evaluation
4.1 Implementation Results and System Evaluation (Overview)
This chapter presents the implemented system, the results obtained during deployment and
operation, and a structured evaluation. We show
(i) smart contract deployment on a private Ethereum network,
(ii) product registration that persists metadata to Swarm and generates QR codes,
(iii) product verification for authentic and counterfeit cases.
(iv) transaction logging. We then evaluate the system theoretically (feature comparison),
quantitatively (latency and gas/cost), and from a security perspective (CIA properties, common
threats, and smart-contract static analysis with Slither).
4.2.1 Smart Contract Deployment
We deploy the Solidity smart contracts on a private Ethereum blockchain using Ganache.
Remix IDE compiles and deploys the contracts, and MetaMask manages accounts and signs
transactions. Result: The contract deploys successfully; constructor events and the deployment
transaction appear in Ganache with the contract address visible. We record the deployed address
and network parameters for reproducibility. Figure 4.1 shows the deployment transaction in
Ganache (TX hash, block number, gas used) and the contract address as reflected in
Remix/MetaMask.

4.2.2 Product Registration
Manufacturers register products through the React.js DApp. On submission.
(1) the product JSON is uploaded to Swarm,.
(2) the Swarm hash (content address) is stored on-chain via the smart contract.
(2) a QR code encoding the product ID is generated.
Result: Each product receives a unique on-chain entry linking productId → swarmHash. Figure
4.2a presents the Product Registration Form, while Figure 4.2b shows the transaction details
confirming that the Swarm hash is recorded on the blockchain. Figure 4.3 shows the Swarm
gateway evidence proving that the product JSON is retrievable by the exact hash stored on-chain.

4.2.3 Product Verification
Retailers and consumers scan the QR code in the DApp’s barcode module. The DApp fetches the
on-chain Swarm hash for that productId, retrieves the product JSON from Swarm, and compares it
to the locally displayed details. Result (Authentic): For authentic products, the DApp displays
correct details consistent with the Swarm JSON and the on-chain hash. Result (Counterfeit/Failed):
For manipulated/counterfeit cases, the DApp flags a verification failure, showing a visible red
status and mismatch reason. Figure 4.4a shows an authentic verification screen; Figure 4.4b shows
a failed verification.

4.2.4 Transaction Logging
Every verification event is logged on-chain with user (or role) identifier, timestamp, and the
verification result. Result: The log entries provide transparent, tamper-evident traces. Figure 4.5
introduces the verification log as seen in Ganache, with columns for productId, verifier, timestamp,
and status.

4.3 System Testing Results
We conduct unit, integration, performance, security, and UAT testing: - Unit Testing: Core
modules each pass their test cases.
- Integration Testing: The end-to-end flow operates
smoothly across components.
- Performance Testing: Average verification latency remains under
3 seconds.
- Security Testing: Unauthorized writes are rejected; verification logic prevents
mismatches.
- UAT: Test users complete tasks successfully, with minor UI fixes applied.

We evaluate gas/cost (registration, verification), and latency under the local deployment. Replace
placeholders with actual measured values.
4.4.3 Security Analysis
We analyze the system under CIA properties, DoS considerations, MitM risks, and static analysis using
Slither. Table below shows example Slither analysis results.

4.4.4 Limitations
- Evaluation uses a private network; public networks introduce real costs.
- Availability depends on Swarm
gateways.
- Prototype user capacity limited; scaling required for production.
4.4.5 Summary
The system integrates blockchain, Swarm, and QR codes to deliver verifiable product authenticity with
transparent logs. Evaluation shows strong theoretical advantages, acceptable latency, and security verified with
